# Deployment Steps
Step 1: Commit Code Changes
1. Commit all code changes to the version control system (e.g., Git).
2. Write a meaningful commit message that describes the changes.

Step 2: Push Code to Remote Repository
1. Push the committed code changes to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2. Ensure that the code changes are pushed to the correct branch (e.g., main, master).

Step 3: Trigger Deployment Pipeline
1. Trigger the deployment pipeline using a CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI).
2. The pipeline should automate the build, test, and deployment process.

Step 4: Build and Test Code
1. The pipeline should build the code and run automated tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).
2. Ensure that all tests pass before proceeding with the deployment.

Step 5: Deploy Code to Production
1. Once the code has passed all tests, deploy it to the production environment.
2. Use a deployment strategy (e.g., rolling update, blue-green deployment) to minimize downtime.

Step 6: Verify Deployment
1. Verify that the code has been successfully deployed to the production environment.
2. Check for any errors or issues that may have occurred during the deployment process.

Step 7: Monitor and Rollback (if necessary)
1. Monitor the production environment for any issues or errors that may have occurred after the deployment.
2. If any issues are found, rollback to a previous version of the code to minimize downtime.
